## In this project, I used Python's SpeechRecognition and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) libraries (among others) to create Cinnamon, a virtual assistant for helping users complete day-to-day tasks as well as provide lots of laughs.

### Key features include:
- Greet user with real-life conversation style
- Send Gmail via voice command
- Search Google via voice command
- Search Wikipedia via voice command (using the wikipedia library)
- Search location on GoogleMaps via voice command
- Auto-play music or a videos on YouTube via voice command
- Tell user their horoscope based on what sign they say
- Tell a randomly generated joke upon request (using the pyjokes library)
- Tell the time (using the ctime library)
- Open Spotify
