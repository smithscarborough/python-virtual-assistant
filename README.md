# python-virtual-assistant

## In this project, I used Python's SpeechRecognition and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) libraries (among others) to create Cinammon, a virtual assistant for helping complete day-to-day tasks as well as provide lots of laughs.

### Some of Cinammon's key functions are as follows:
* Greet you by name based on what name you give her
* Tell you the time
* Tell you a joke (which is always new)
* Tell you your horoscope
* Perform a Google search 
* Perform a Wikipedia search 
* Find a location using GoogleMaps
* Play requested song or video on YouTube
* Send email
* Open Spotify
